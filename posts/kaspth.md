Hi, everyone! This is <a href="https://twitter.com/kaspth" title="Kasper Timm Hansen">@kaspth</a>. You may know me from <a href="https://t.co/Qn6QYLhMWw">rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com</a>, <a href="https://t.co/LNIBAhiQ26">dev.firmafon.com/blog</a>, or, just as likely, nothing at all 😁

Daytime gig is with <a href="https://twitter.com/Firmafon" title="Firmafon">@Firmafon</a>, while nighttime shindigs belong to <a href="https://twitter.com/rails" title="Ruby on Rails">@rails</a>.

I generally don’t plan that far ahead, but feel free to ask me questions in English to your hearts content 😎

10 minutes in, I’ve already made my first mistake. Our blog is at <a href="https://t.co/kJ79bTW8BH">dev.firmafon.dk/blog</a>.

Only really dig in to Open Source on nights and weekends :)

Currently no sponsorships, no. <a href="https://t.co/MKyEyrkGAr">twitter.com/kirshatrov/sta…</a>

Never did anything of note until I was a Google summer of code student for Rails. <a href="https://t.co/WM1fQVFa4c">twitter.com/gmile/status/6…</a>

Then things went pretty quiet until I started helping out with Rails’ Global ID repo mostly in August-October 2014.

Early 2015, I started watching the Rails repo, just to get a feel for things. About 2-3 weeks in, I began reviewing PRs.

Because of my long history with the Rails people (they knew to trust me), I was promoted to Rails’ issues team.

Kept reviewing pull requests and made it to Rails’ committers team June-July.

If you want to contribute to Rails, I’d say thoughtful feedback focusing on tuning PR readability is your best bet. Keep building trust!

Oh, I’d also add don’t try to win anything by it. I’m not aiming for core team or anything. The work is worthy in and of itself 😁

Why’s Poignant Guide was the first time I saw Ruby (ca. 2009). A year later, Rails for Zombies showed me Rails. <a href="https://t.co/3il70t9xSp">twitter.com/pinyslutty/sta…</a>

GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN FOLKS <a href="https://t.co/TVJ85h5Yvm">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>

Craig Hockenberry’s App Development: The Missing Manual recommended Why’s Poignant Guide to Ruby. <a href="https://t.co/Ns8TGmyQhc">twitter.com/Shiroginne/sta…</a>

I thought for a long time iOS was the thing (too sucked in by the Mac blogosphere). Ruby was still there in the backseat.

It wasn’t until I started deciding for myself. I realized just how much iOS development sucked, and how much more fun Ruby and the web was.

On a serious note: fuck no. Frameworks with batteries included all the way! <a href="https://t.co/IvK7isDQUw">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>

Just trying to get better at Ruby mostly. I hear good things about it though :)

<a href="https://t.co/BzpGdQADWJ">twitter.com/thetaktes/stat…</a>

By the way, Pheonix's model for Web Sockets were an inspiration to Action Cable ;)

Great! More Rails for the rest of us 😎

Make software development exist 🤓<a href="https://t.co/19fe4Gu221">twitter.com/nick_jastix/st…</a>1

Less cheeky: have no idea. Don’t think you choose your profession as much as your profession chooses you.

Which, partly means, I suck at choosing. For better or worse, most of my life has been drifting.

I was pretty staunch about not taking a formal CS degree. Already great at “school”, I wanted something were I was in charge.

Has anybody tried Turbolinks in their apps? We have an Angular setup, but would like to switch to less academic JS.

.<a href="https://twitter.com/Firmafon" title="Firmafon">@Firmafon</a> is a carrier, so just having software that is intuitive and works is a blessing for people.

In other words we’re not making an ambitious web application as Ember puts it 😁

Aww, that sucks. Are you just running without a JS framework? :) <a href="https://t.co/FBe0jYAph3">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>

The Leprechaun got out of the console 😁<a href="https://t.co/to6sECvGQ4">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>4

Haven’t looked very much into them. I have heard Go being thrown around a lot lately for what that’s worth. <a href="https://t.co/bmPaMGDxoS">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>

About Lisp, I've watched most of 80's MIT's computing intro lectures: <a href="https://t.co/MAp4Fk3zWF">ocw.mit.edu/courses/electr…</a> — holds up well!

<a href="https://t.co/JLhS9EzRjL">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>

Ah, really! What was the project? :)

(Yes, I have a 2013 student t-shirt and a 2015 mentor one)

<a href="https://t.co/GiQZ1KIW7V">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>

I like Turbolinks partly because it's not meant as a blackhole.

<a href="https://t.co/3V7rF91NiS">twitter.com/artofhuman/sta…</a>

Facebook and Google always have a surplus of programmers to throw at React and Angular, while Basecamp still keeps it to 10-12.

That matters a lot for our team of 4 developers :)

Jim Weirich gave a talk about the SICP book from the course:

<a href="https://t.co/Vfqw6bPtK7">confreaks.tv/videos/gogaruc…</a>

Well, the first two "mind-blowing" chapters :)

Every time I hear that I think about Shopify: <a href="https://t.co/CctwXfRGKo">shopify.com/technology/156…</a>.

The end result sounds far nicer :)

<a href="https://t.co/VEslYRp4vL">twitter.com/rainrb/status/…</a>

Nice! :D

<a href="https://t.co/cmH545u3p5">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>

Our app has enough complexity elsewhere 🤓

Yes, “fun”! You get way more cred for using one of those frameworks. Turbolinks is boring. <a href="https://t.co/LgRtDhUZLv">twitter.com/common_disease…</a>

RT <a href="https://twitter.com/listochkin" title="Андрей Листочкин">@listochkin</a>: .<a href="https://twitter.com/rubyunderhood" title="Ruby developer">@rubyunderhood</a> Take a look at Pjax. Here <a href="https://twitter.com/StarrHorne" title="Starr Horne">@StarrHorne</a> talks about their experience and why they picked Pjax over TL https:/<a href="https://t.co/3vajNvJHkA">confreaks.tv/videos/madison…</a>

Funny how many say they remove Turbolinks from new apps, but I haven’t seen any mention --skip-turbolinks 😁

Yeah, from what I’ve seen it is less complex. <a href="https://t.co/zSaZUuU2TG">twitter.com/rainrb/status/…</a>

minitest-focus is pretty neat. I usually go for byebug if I need a debugger. <a href="https://t.co/gJVm24l4q2">twitter.com/rainrb/status/…</a>

Otherwise being the designated Rails upgrader at our company, I’d say the fewer dependencies the better.

We just switched to Rails 4.2 Monday, and nearly got caught in a virtuous cycle of dependency upgrade forcing another upgrade :/

Depends on how you like your Monday’s, I guess.

Personally I can only stand a 24 hour dose in a day <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pun">#pun</a>

method_source is also cool (which pry uses I believe). Have never been a big pry guy. What do you like about it? :) <a href="https://t.co/mIHAbSaQD2">twitter.com/rainrb/status/…</a>

My pedigree is no degree 😁

How much of school is self funded in Russia? In Denmark the government pays all.<a href="https://t.co/qCb7mvGZuh">twitter.com/common_disease…</a>h

I was drifting toward university too because I’d taken dogma as fact: “you got good grades, you *ought* to go to university”. Bah, humbug!

Good point. It’s not a direct apples to apples comparison.

Public framework usually beats homegrown. <a href="https://t.co/gEnk8UMCt3">twitter.com/common_disease…</a>

I’m even more esoteric than DHH here. I use Chocolat, which does the job and looks like a Mac app. <a href="https://t.co/O0PpM5tfjO">twitter.com/nick_jastix/st…</a>

Do use Vim for commit messages, so I get trained slowly.

Thanks! I’ll look into it :) <a href="https://t.co/TMNKJ2xL2n">twitter.com/listochkin/sta…</a>

They’d save time if they did, I think 😁<a href="https://t.co/gOTUBC4FLY">twitter.com/fat0troll/stat…</a>Y

## Четверг <small>22 твита</small>

Love Minitest to bits and can’t stand Rspec :D

Flame on! <a href="https://t.co/IX6nSITBeH">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>

Dang it, we forgot to get those in for Rails 5 🤓<a href="https://t.co/r5GLChjOWJ">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>J

Convention over configuration triumphs again! <a href="https://t.co/L7BjRIC2eG">twitter.com/rainrb/status/…</a>

Hope you like it. I’m not very advanced with editors.

Typing things out by hand doesn’t need to be :) <a href="https://t.co/R8ano9WLRm">twitter.com/rainrb/status/…</a>

Sounds like you made the right choice 👌<a href="https://t.co/djxWSGdTQh">twitter.com/vassilevsky/st…</a>h

Also, don’t get me started on grades.

Fancy pseudo science people sorter that can do no wrong. <a href="https://t.co/djxWSGdTQh">twitter.com/vassilevsky/st…</a>

If I recall correctly grades were invented in late 18th century. Why haven’t we “disrupted” them yet?

/rant

Mostly interested in rounding out my stack at the moment. I still suck at finding stuff in logs for instance. <a href="https://t.co/TmKgVA78YG">twitter.com/rainrb/status/…</a>

What I’m saying is: I already have one area mapped out and don’t care much for differing perspectives right now. In time that will change.

Interesting. I should look more into it. <a href="https://t.co/aCKe3C12vO">twitter.com/common_disease…</a>

Also if you’re reading this and mainly use `puts` for debugging? Don’t fret!

Lots of people and it’s fine 😎

To me, byebug covers that just fine.

I get tired of typing `continue` to step instead of just `s`. <a href="https://t.co/1mHcF3mTIt">twitter.com/rainrb/status/…</a>

But we could be on an old version, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Given that it’s tiny, it should be much easier to grok too :) <a href="https://t.co/TkzRSqcKMN">twitter.com/jastkand/statu…</a>

Ha! That rings true to me 😁<a href="https://t.co/7AUnY3yIlP">twitter.com/ZaZooBred/stat…</a>P

I don’t want to be mean to people who have degrees, but usually people with PH.D.s get touted as the ultimate achievers by society.

Or as reaching it is a milestone. I just won’t accept that.

Doesn’t feel like a Mac app to me.

I know what that sounds like coming from a web developer 😱<a href="https://t.co/8fmdjrsPDW">twitter.com/Shiroginne/sta…</a>W

That, and hackability isn’t a selling point for me.

I just want boring old software that works. <a href="https://t.co/OmVlgKlS0P">twitter.com/rainrb/status/…</a>

Ha! That’s pretty great 😁<a href="https://t.co/pGhSgTN4Mo">twitter.com/Shiroginne/sta…</a>o

Don’t know about that one :) <a href="https://t.co/FGHTlymcj4">twitter.com/anton_davydov/…</a>

My point wasn’t to find an alternative. It’s no one has been sought.

(Also fuck no, that would be horrible.) <a href="https://t.co/vbsxLzLwJq">twitter.com/common_disease…</a>

Nothing wrong with that! I’d just like to *try* to keep it to one area at the moment. <a href="https://t.co/kUU3hJU14C">twitter.com/rainrb/status/…</a>

I’ve demanded a raise before. Unfortunately, I, not the exception, got fired. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23pun">#pun</a> <a href="https://t.co/0ivEZTwwLx">twitter.com/ZaZooBred/stat…</a>

Agreed, and that’s usually orthogonal to education. <a href="https://t.co/6M7RnXlOkn">twitter.com/ZaZooBred/stat…</a>

Conventions and standards trumps isomorphism by far. <a href="https://t.co/u1EX4HBk6o">twitter.com/kirylkiryl/sta…</a>

Saw a demo of Volt once, the example controller was a grabbag.

That part felt like a huge step back to me.

I think much of that movement is a ruse from on high.

All they talk about is the dollars they can gain. <a href="https://t.co/2TntgyyySR">twitter.com/Shiroginne/sta…</a>

Code is terrible for most people. It’s a horrible interface to gaining intuitive rationality.

My clarity of thinking improved massively once programming clicked.

But gaining that through code is not for most people.

We should have something better than code. I have no idea what that will be, but I’m fascinated by Bret Victor’s research.

He’s trying to unlock other ways of thinking by shifting our perspective. And whips up amazing demos 😎

No. Likely because the Danish government hasn’t figured out how to make money off those people yet. <a href="https://t.co/ziHuE514nB">twitter.com/Shiroginne/sta…</a>

Not enough to remember specifics. Damn handy for a lot of little things though! <a href="https://t.co/MBPqElthH9">twitter.com/pinyslutty/sta…</a>

Alright, folks! This has been a blast. Thanks for the good questions.
